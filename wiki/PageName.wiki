= Introduction =

I need to say that I'm not a good English spoken but Im doing my best.
Pyventa is a software developed under PyQt4, which means that in some how it supposed to  run under any OS, but I made it under Linux more specifically Ubuntu 8.10 so I oriented the settings for work in that enviroment, that because I can't test it under any OS. It may look like a little professional from my part but  is open source I people you can adapted for Windows work or any other OS.
